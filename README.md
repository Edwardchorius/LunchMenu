# LunchMenu
In the time period of around 8 hours I managed to code so much. What I would have liked to have done is to write some tests. If I had gone TDD approach I may have written tests. The tests would target the applicatin services and any validation logic around the domain layer as a whole. No UI has been written whatsoever as well, so as some application logic around the domain.
